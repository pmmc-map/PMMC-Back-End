# PMMC-Back-End

## Back end
- Consists of a Flask back-end that serves a single HTML file (essentially a route that directs our "/" endpoint).
- Will contain our REST API + endpoints that will connect to our database (MySQL, Postgres?, NoSQL?..)

To start Flask app for local development:  
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run # This will start a local dev server

## Front end
